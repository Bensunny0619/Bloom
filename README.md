Bloom Frontend Design



**Initial Set up**

Step 1: npm install (to install required dependendies).

Step 2: npx tailwindcss -i ./css/app.css -o ./css/styles.css --watch



**Subsequently**

npx tailwindcss -i ./css/app.css -o ./css/styles.css --watch

***Custom Colours***

Two custom colours were added for simplicity

1. bloom-black (for the background colour)
2. bloom-orange (for the Bloom brand colour)

These colours can be used just like other colours for both background i.e bg-bloom-black text-bloom-black text-bloom-orange

****Custom styles****

Please custom styles should be avoided as much as possible but if absolutely essential, can be added to ./css/app.css and must be well formatted

****Style Guide****

1. Please format you templates properly
2. Comment every section clearly
